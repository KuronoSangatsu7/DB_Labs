We need a database for a shop that sells electronics, mainly computer parts. The shop sells computers including Desktops and Laptops, as well as accessories for these devices.

A customer who wishes to buy a Desktop can choose between different component options, including Sound Card, Memory, and Video Card options. Meanwhile, a customer who wishes to buy a Laptop can only choose between different memory options.

A computer includes a pre-installed Operating System as well as some software that comes along with it.

Accessories that are sold with the computer consist of 3 main categories, namely, Keyboards, Mice, and Monitors.

Of course, all the entities mentioned above possess some basic attributes, such as the Manufacturing Company and the Color of an accessory. The License and Publishing Party of a piece of software. The weight of a Laptop, and the Type of Inputs on a sound card.
